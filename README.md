# learning Shell script
Shell Scripting notes and code for my reference:

* [lotto.sh](lotto.sh) - Ramdon select six numbers in the range 1-59

* [verbose.sh](verbose.sh) - checking existing file, else copy one, with or without generates a lot of output.

* [mysystem.sh](mysystem.sh) - checking info on current connected users.
